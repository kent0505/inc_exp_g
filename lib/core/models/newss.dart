    name: 'The BRICS Currency Charade',
    content:
        'Expressions of dissatisfaction with the global dominance of the dollar go back at least to French finance minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1965. But even today, the euro is no challenger to the greenback, and no one should hold their breath waiting for the BRICS to unveil their own attempt at an alternative currency.\n\nATHENS – Last month’s BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, was, like all summits, heavy on photo ops. And it yielded a second act that was similarly heavier on symbolism than substance: the release of a report by the Russian finance ministry and central bank on “improvement of the international monetary and financial system,” by which Russian officials obviously meant “finding an alternative to the weaponized dollar.”\n\nExpressions of dissatisfaction with the dominance of the dollar over global money and finance go back at least to French finance minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1965, who famously lamented the greenback’s “exorbitant privilege.” Indeed, the desire for an alternative played no small part in the creation of the euro 34 years later.\n\nHerein lies the rub for the BRICS (named for its founding members Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Creating the euro took 34 years. It necessarily built on a half-century of other steps that deepened European integration and established shared political institutions. And the euro, in any case, has shown no signs of challenging the dollar, or even of modestly denting its global supremacy.\n\nPolicymakers in emerging markets have in fact offered a long list of possible substitutes for the dollar. None of their proposals has borne fruit. In 2009, People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Zhou Xiaochuan suggested replacing dollar reserves with the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights. It quickly became apparent that no one was particularly interested in holding, much less using, an artificial asset pegged to an arbitrary currency basket.\n\nChinese officials then embarked on a campaign to promote use of the renminbi in international payments. In fact, Chinese firms now settle a majority of their cross-border transactions in renminbi. Globally, however, the renminbi accounts for less than 6% of trade settlements, while Chinese capital controls and governance issues limit the currency’s utility for financial transactions. Despite having built a Cross-Border Interbank Payments System, Chinese banks clear barely 3% of the daily transactions, by value, of US-based clearing houses.\n\nThen came proposals for a BRICS currency, constituted as a weighted average of existing BRICS currencies, or perhaps backed by gold or other commodities. But a BRICS basket currency was not a natural fit for any of its member countries’ exporters. With no BRICS equivalent of the European Central Bank, which manages the euro, or of the European Parliament, to which the ECB answers, fundamental questions – like who would manage it – remained unanswered.\n\nA gold-backed currency would have obvious appeal to major gold producers like Russia and South Africa. But payments would be expensive, insofar as they involved actual gold shipments. If “gold-backed” meant convertible into gold at the prevailing market price, then the unit would not be stable. If it meant convertible at a fixed price, this would be tantamount to donning the straitjacket of the gold standard.\n\nThere have since been discussions of local currency settlement, like those occupying Russia and India for much of 2023. But this could work only if bilateral trade were perfectly balanced, with neither country having much appetite for accumulating the currency of the other. The benefits of multilateral trade would be lost. Predictably, these Russia-India talks led nowhere – except to Kazan.\n\nThe Russian report to the BRICS summit recommended a common platform for cross-border payments using a set of BRICS central-bank digital currencies. This could avoid having to go through the dollar, the US banking system, and the SWIFT interbank payment service. The Bank for International Settlements has helped to develop such a platform, known as Project mBridge, with the participation of five central banks, including the PBOC, which is said to be privy to the technical details, having designed many of them. The accession of additional emerging markets could provide for own-currency settlement while preserving a modicum of multilateralism. Participants might be happy about holding one another’s currencies now that these were usable at low cost throughout the bloc.\n\nBut if the technological problem has been solved, the governance problem remains. Participants would have to agree on who to license as foreign-exchange dealers on the platform, or on the exchange rate at which to execute trades algorithmically. They would have to agree on who was responsible for providing liquidity, and under what conditions. They would have to agree on a dispute-settlement mechanism. They would have to agree on privacy and data-protection laws and practices, and how to guard against cyber threats. They would have to agree on the enforcement of anti-money-laundering rules. They would have to agree on which central banks could join over time. They would have to agree on ownership and voting shares, analogous to ownership and voting shares in SWIFT.\n\nIn their Kazan Declaration, summit participants limply “recognized” the role of the BRICS in improving the international monetary and financial system, and “took note” of the Russian report. No one should be surprised that they failed to do more.',

    name: 'What to know before buying gold, silver, or platinum from Costco',
    content:
        'Costco (COST) has added new products to its catalog, and they may someday rival the famous rotisserie chicken in popularity. The club store now sells gold bars, silver coins, and platinum bars — three precious metals that many investors use to diversify their wealth.\n\nThe timing of Costco\'s move into precious metals has been fortunate. The club store first offered gold bars in 2023, then added silver and platinum over the next year or so. Meanwhile, gold is hanging around its all-time high. Both gold and silver are up more than 30% in 2024. Platinum is lagging by comparison, roughly flat on the year and well below its peak price reached in 2008.\n\nIntrigued by Costco\'s precious metals offering? Read on to learn key considerations for precious metals investing, the details of the Costco selection, and tips for managing your new investment.\n\nWhat to know about investing in gold, silver, or platinum\n\nInvestors view gold, silver, and platinum as stores of value, meaning they maintain their purchasing power over time without depreciating. However, the three metals have somewhat different characteristics. Those differences may influence how much of each you should own.\n\nGold is a "monetary metal," according to Vince Stanzione, CEO and founder of investment publisher First Information. Because gold prices often rise when the value of the U.S. dollar falls, many central banks hold gold to hedge against inflation and promote economic stability. Ongoing demand from central banks contributes to a generally positive medium- to long-term outlook for gold.\n\nSilver and platinum have greater industrial uses relative to gold. Silver is used in consumer electronics, electric cars, and solar panels, for example. Platinum is used in automotive applications such as catalytic converters and in the production of glassware, among other things. Due to the industrial demand, these two metals are more dependent on the economy than gold. This can encourage volatility in the short term.\n\nCostco\'s precious metal selection\n\n1. 24-karat gold in 1-ounce bars\n2. 20-count packs of 1-ounce silver coins\n3. 999.5 pure platinum in 1-ounce bars\n\nCostco’s precious metals pricing varies and is only visible online to members. In April 2024, one buyer reported paying \$2,359 for a gold bar. By October 2024, the price had increased to more than \$2,800 — roughly 2% above gold\'s spot price.\n\nIt is normal for dealers to sell gold above the spot price. Markups can range from 1% to 30%, depending on the services the dealer provides. Relative to that range, Costco\'s 2% markup is reasonable.\n\nAs of Nov. 7, 2024, you could buy Costco\'s silver coins for \$699.99, and the platinum bars debuted in October at a price point of \$1,089.99.\n\nHow to buy Costco gold bars, silver coins, or platinum bars\n\nTo buy precious metals from Costco, you must have an active Costco membership. And, since the metals are often out of stock, you must also have good timing. All purchases of gold, silver, or platinum must be made online at Costco.com. Also, Costco does not sell gold, silver, or platinum in Louisiana, Nevada, and Puerto Rico.\n\nCostco limits buyers to one purchase per membership and a maximum of five units. At current prices, this caps your gold purchase at about \$14,000. Silver and platinum buyers can only spend about \$3,700 and \$5,500, respectively.\n\nFor many investors, these amounts are too low to satisfy a diversification requirement or ensure long-term wealth. For context, Brandon Thor, CEO of The Thor Metals Group, recommends investing 10% to 20% of portfolio assets in gold to mitigate the risk of loss in a financial crisis. The well-known “All Weather Portfolio,” designed by billionaire investor Ray Dalio, includes a 7.5% gold position.',

    name: 'How do credit unions make money?',
    content:
        'Credit unions are not-for-profit, member-owned banking cooperatives. Unlike traditional banks, they aim to serve their members rather than maximize shareholder profits.\n\nEven so, credit unions need to make money to continue operating. Given their different business model compared to banks, you might wonder how credit unions make money.\n\nHow credit unions make money\n\nFor the most part, credit unions make money the same way traditional banks do. However, credit unions often share their profits with members through lower fees and competitive rates. Here’s a closer look at the main ways credit unions make money and how members benefit.\n\nInterest on loans\n\nWhen you deposit money at a credit union, it pools those funds with other customer deposits to lend money in the form of mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and more. The interest rates it charges on those loans are higher than the rates it pays on deposits. And that difference — known as the net interest margin — is one of the credit union’s primary sources of income.\n\nInvestments\n\nIn addition to providing loans, credit unions also use funds on deposit to invest in relatively low-risk, interest-earning securities, like government bonds or similar instruments. These investments provide a stable source of income without taking on too much risk, keeping in line with the conservative and member-focused mission of credit unions.\n\nFees\n\nCredit unions charge various fees, such as loan origination fees, monthly account fees, overdraft fees, and membership fees.\n\nAs member-owned not-for-profit institutions, credit unions often prioritize keeping fees low. However, they must still charge some fees to fund their operations. These fees help cover the administrative costs involved with managing members’ accounts and loans, and contribute to total revenue.\n\nWhat do credit unions do with the money they make?\n\nAlthough credit unions are not-for-profit organizations, they still bring in revenue, often more than their operating expenses. However, credit unions typically share their excess revenue with members rather than pocketing the difference.\n\nCompetitive rates and low fees\n\nCredit unions don’t give cash directly to their members the way publicly traded companies issue dividends to their shareholders. Instead, they return their excess revenue to members through competitive interest rates and lower fees.\n\nCredit unions might offer lower rates on various loan types, such as mortgages, auto loans, personal loans, and credit cards. This is beneficial to members because it makes borrowing more affordable and accessible. With lower rates, members can save hundreds or even thousands in interest payments over the life of the loan, depending on the loan type and amount.\n\nCredit unions also offer various deposit accounts, such as high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market accounts, which often pay much higher interest rates and come with lower fees than those offered by traditional banks. With higher rates and lower fees, members can grow their savings faster, making it worth keeping their money at a credit union.\n\nEnhanced member services\n\nAnother way credit unions reinvest in their membership is by improving the services offered, such as increasing ATM or branch locations, or improving digital banking technology. They may also create financial literacy programs, community events, or workshops to help members make informed financial decisions.\n\nCommunity development\n\nMany credit unions also invest in community-focused initiatives, such as funding local charities, offering small business loans to underserved populations, or providing grants and scholarships.\n\nCredit unions’ approach to making money and reinvesting revenue is uniquely focused on serving members and strengthening communities. Through interest on loans, fees, investments, and other revenue-generating activities, credit unions generate income. The big difference is that they use those funds to lower costs for members, improve services, build financial stability, and generally give back to members and the community.',

        'Consumer prices rose in line with expectations in October, signaling further moderation of inflation. But economists expect that trend could reverse quickly if Donald Trump follows through with his promises to impose 10%-20% tariffs on all imports and a 60% tariff on Chinese goods.\n\nThe proposed tariffs are estimated to cost the average American household \$2,600 per year, according to a calculation by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). The Yale Budget Lab estimated the impact could be as high as \$7,600 per household when factoring in the ripple effects of such actions, including retaliation from other countries.\n\n"There\'s never an expectation that domestic goods stay cheap after tariffs," said Kimberly Clausing, a senior fellow at PIIE. "They always rise with the tariff price.\n\nClausing estimated that the combination of new tariffs Trump proposed could create consumer costs of at least 1.8% of GDP, not including additional costs from retaliatory tariffs and lost competitiveness.\n\nThe impact of those cost increases would be nearly five times greater than the additional tariffs imposed during the first Trump administration, Clausing said.\n\n"The kind of tariffs Trump is talking about could easily be 50 basis points of inflation," Karen Karniol-Tambour, co-chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, said at Yahoo Finance’s Invest Conference. She added, "In the environment we were in in 2016, [it] was not a big deal, but [in] the environment we’re in today, it’s a bigger deal."\n\n',

    content:
        'Demand deposit accounts (DDAs) are one of the most commonly used types of bank accounts. They’re an essential banking tool for handling daily financial needs and allowing easy access to cash.\n\nRead on to learn more about how demand deposit accounts work, common examples, and the benefits and drawbacks they offer.\n\nWhat is a demand deposit account, and how does it work?\n\nDemand deposit accounts are bank accounts that allow the account holder to withdraw money without first requesting permission from the bank. Unlike time deposits (which require you to lock your funds in for a specific period) or investments (which require you to sell your assets in order to access the money), the funds in demand deposit accounts are readily available for withdrawal without advance notice or penalty.\n\nCommon examples of demand deposit accounts include checking accounts and certain savings accounts. Funds in these accounts are considered "on demand" since you can access the money whenever needed — you simply visit an ATM, swipe a debit card, write a check, or initiate a bank transfer. That makes demand deposit accounts ideal for everyday spending.\n\nIt’s important to note that there may still be fees involved for certain types of transactions, depending on your bank’s policies, such as using out-of-network ATMs or making excess withdrawals.\n\nSome demand deposit accounts may also earn interest or even rewards, but this isn’t a requirement.\n\nExamples of demand deposit accounts\n\nThere are a few types of accounts that fall under the category of demand deposits:\n\nChecking accounts: These are the most common type of demand deposit account. You generally use checking accounts to manage day-to-day transactions, such as paying bills, buying groceries, and making loan payments.\n\nSavings accounts: These accounts are designed to hold money long-term for goals such as building an emergency fund, saving for a down payment, or funding a future vacation. Typically, you can pull your money out as needed. However, some savings accounts limit the number of withdrawals you can make to six per month. If you go over this limit, you may incur a fee or other penalty.\n\nMoney market accounts (MMAs): These accounts work like hybrid checking/savings accounts. They allow you to hold your savings and often pay competitive interest rates, but also often come with checks and/or a debit card so you can easily pull out funds as needed. MMAs also often come with higher minimum balance requirements and monthly fees.\n\n',

    name: 'How much money should you keep in a savings account?',
    content:
        'What\'s the "right" amount of money to have in a savings account? If you follow expert recommendations, you\'ll probably end up confused. Is it six months\' worth of your expenses? Twenty percent of each paycheck? Or some other magic figure? The answer depends on who you ask.\n\nSometimes so-called financial experts, gurus, and coaches offer conflicting or just-plain bad advice because they\'re not trained professionals and/or they\'re not really in touch with the financial challenges of the average person.\n\nAs a former NFCC-certified credit counselor — one who\'s counseled thousands of households through budget crises — I strongly suggest ignoring any "expert" who offers a blanket solution. Instead, you can use the guidelines below to help you find a fit for your situation.\n\nWhy do you need money in a savings account?\n\nThe main reason to keep money in a savings account is for emergencies. Or more accurately, your savings help prevent a difficult event from becoming an emergency. For example, any of the following expenses can spiral into a crisis if you don\'t have enough savings to cover them:\n\nHome repair\nRent increase\nCar breakdown\nLoss of hours at work\nMedically necessary procedure\nTravel expenses for the funeral of a loved one\n\nUltimately, the money in your savings account is there to protect you in one of the worst-case scenarios: The total loss of your income. If that happens, your savings can act as a form of income replacement, giving you time to find a new job or make other arrangements without falling behind on bills.\n\nAs an added benefit, you can withdraw money from a savings account at almost any time without incurring a penalty or losses, which is not the case for money in a retirement account, certificate of deposit (CD), or the stock market.\n\nHow much money should I keep in my savings account?\n\nThe ideal amount of savings depends on your situation, and it can change along with your circumstances. Here\'s how to determine the amount you need:\n\nIf you\'re in debt…\n\nIf you have high-interest debt, meaning debt with APR above 7% (think: credit cards), your savings account balance should be kept to a minimum.\n\nThat might sound counterintuitive. However, instead of putting your extra cash into a savings account or retirement fund, you\'ll want to aggressively pay off the debt to avoid losing money on monthly interest charges.\n\nIt\'s also wise to build a "cushion" into your checking account, meaning a limited amount of funds that you never plan to spend. Having a cushion equivalent to your largest monthly expense — usually rent or a mortgage payment — helps you avoid costly overdraft fees and serves as a backup to ensure your housing payment is covered in a serious emergency.\n\nIf your income and expenses are stable…\n\nIf you don\'t have high-interest debt, aim to maintain three-to-six months\' worth of your living expenses (not your income) in a savings account. Yes, that\'s a wide range, but it\'s relatively easy to figure out which end you should aim toward.\n\nThree months\' worth of living expenses is sufficient if you have a low likelihood of facing long-term unemployment or major, unexpected expenses. Aim to save roughly three months of expenses if all of the following apply to you:\n\nYour income is consistent and stable.\nYour expenses are largely predictable.\nYou work in a moderate-to-high-demand profession.\nYou have no dependents.',

    content:
        'Chevron (NYSE: CVX) stock has rallied 5.5% since the company reported third-quarter 2024 earnings on Nov. 1. The integrated oil and gas major continues to deliver solid results and return capital to shareholders through a combination of buybacks and dividends.\n\nChevron is projected to pay around \$11.8 billion in dividends in 2024, which is even more than well-known passive income powerhouse Coca-Cola, which should end up paying around \$8 billion in dividends this year.\n\nStart Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »\n\nHere\'s why Chevron is an excellent dividend stock to consider buying now.\n\nManaging through the cycle\n\nInternational energy giants can\'t control oil and gas prices, but they can improve their production portfolios to ensure they can achieve good profit margins even at lower prices. Chevron has been doing just that.\n\nOn its third-quarter earnings call, Chevron said that around 75% of its locations can break even below \$50 per barrel. For context, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices, the U.S. benchmark, averaged \$77.58 per barrel in 2023. And even during the collapse in 2020, WTI still averaged \$39.16. So, building a portfolio around \$50 oil provides a nice margin for error to do well even in a lower oil price environment.\n\nIn its earnings release, Chevron said that asset sales in Canada, Congo, and Alaska are part of its plan to divest \$10 billion to \$15 billion by 2026, with further structural changes expected to reduce costs by \$2 billion to \$3 billion from 2024 to the end of 2026. So Chevron\'s breakeven could fall even more in the coming years.\n\nFor the recent quarter, Chevron grew worldwide net oil equivalent production by 7% thanks to higher U.S. and Permian Basin production. The higher production helped offset lower oil and gas prices. All told, Chevron\'s upstream earnings only fell 20% compared to third-quarter 2023. But overall earnings came in at just \$2.48 per share compared to \$3.48 per share in the same quarter last year -- mainly due to a substantial slowdown in Chevron\'s downstream business.\n\nStill, Chevron\'s free cash flow (FCF) for the first three quarters of 2024 was \$10.7 billion compared to \$11.7 billion for the same period last year. The company\'s ability to generate substantial earnings and FCF even in a mid-cycle price environment showcases why Chevron has an elite upstream portfolio.\n\nReturning capital to shareholders\n\nLike most oil and gas companies, Chevron\'s profits evaporated during the COVID-19-induced downturn. In fact, it reported a net loss of \$5.54 billion in 2020. Despite the loss, Chevron not only kept paying a dividend, but also raised the payout as it has done for 37 consecutive years.\n\nChevron delivered for its shareholders despite the lousy year due to the strength of its balance sheet. As the oil and gas industry recovered, Chevron used outsize profits to reward its shareholders even more with buybacks and dividends, and still have enough dry powder left over to pay down debt. Over the last three years, Chevron has reduced its share count by 6.9% and increased its dividend by 21.6%. It finished the third quarter of 2024 with a net debt ratio of 11.9%, which was higher than 8.1% in Q3 2023 because Chevron has been ramping up its spending. Still, the leverage ratio remains at a very healthy level. Chevron\'s net debt ratio shows the company\'s leverage net of cash balances. The lower the net debt ratio, the less the business depends on debt.\n\nChevron stock is an excellent way to generate passive income\n\nGiven the cyclicality of the oil and gas industry, it is rare to find a financially healthy company with a clear path toward future earnings growth, a stable and reliable dividend, and a compelling yield. Chevron checks all those boxes. Its 4.2% dividend yield is considerably above the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. Chevron isn\'t an expensive stock either. On the conservative end, it will likely finish 2024 booking over \$10 per share in earnings, giving it a price-to-earnings ratio under 16, which is attractive, given Chevron isn\'t even operating in a booming oil and gas environment.All told, Chevron remains a good value and an excellent way to boost your passive income stream.\n\nShould you invest \$1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

Since then, Apple has evolved from a niche computer maker into a global technology leader, revolutionizing the market with products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, before ultimately becoming the first company to reach a \$3 trillion valuation.\n\nLet\'s examine how Apple\'s stock splits have affected the number of shares an investor would hold today if they bought at the initial public offering (IPO) and held on, as well as the total return over time.\n\nApple\'s stock split history\n\nApple has split its stock five times throughout its 44-year history as a publicly traded company, most recently 4-for-1 in 2020. By increasing the number of shares each shareholder owns, stock splits reduce the per-share price, attracting more retail investors without changing a company\'s market capitalization.\n\nA stock split can also help a company qualify for inclusion in a price-weighted index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which Apple joined in 2015. In such indexes, a company\'s influence is based on its share price, so keeping the price within a certain range can be beneficial.\n\nGiven the company\'s five stock splits, if you had purchased just one share of Apple at its IPO in 1980, you would hold 224 shares today. Moreover, with today\'s stock price of approximately \$224 per share, one share purchased on the first day of trading would be worth \$50,176.\n\nNotably, this figure does not include dividends, which the company paid quarterly between 1987 and 1995 and from 2012 to the present.\n\nThe takeaway is that Apple exemplifies the life-changing rewards that can come from a commitment to long-term investing, showcasing how buying and holding quality companies can yield extraordinary returns over time.\n\n',

    name: 'Dollar Rises as Traders Reprice December Fed Cut: Markets Wrap',
    content:
        '(Bloomberg) -- Asian equities were set to climb early Friday even as traders scaled back expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut next month which weighed on US stocks and strengthened the dollar.\n\nAustralian shares edged higher while Japanese and Hong Kong equity futures rose. Contracts for Tokyo benchmarks were supported by further weakness in the yen as an index of greenback strength advanced for a fifth session on Thursday. US equity futures were slightly lower in early Asian trading.\n\nThe action was driven by further signs of resilience in the US economy and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank will be in no rush to cut interest rates. Powell\'s comments appear in line with some of his other colleagues who are advocating a go-slow approach to future rate reductions.\n\nUS two-year yields, which are more sensitive to monetary policy, spiked after the remarks and traders dialed back bets on a December rate reduction to below 60% — from 80% in the previous day. Australian and New Zealand yields climbed early Friday.\n\n"Powell\'s speech was hawkish," said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. "I think they will still cut in December since policy remains restrictive and they want to get to a neutral setting. That said, on the economy, I think Powell (and the broader consensus) is complacent. There is more downside risk in the near-term than is being appreciated."\n\nIn Asia, the yen was steady Friday after weakening past 156 per dollar on Thursday, rekindling speculation over the potential for officials to step in to support the currency. Emerging market currencies extended losses.\n\nInvestors will also be looking for any market reaction to Chinese retail and industrial production data due Friday in the wake of stimulus measures announced by Beijing in the past few weeks.\n\nElsewhere, data set for release in the region includes gross-domestic product for Japan, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, while trade numbers in Indonesia are expected. Markets are closed in India.\n\nIn commodities, copper headed for a seventh consecutive weekly fall, partly driven by concerns over demand from China. Oil steadied on Friday after advancing in the prior session, while gold was little changed.\n\nResilient Economy\n\nData earlier Thursday in the US showed producer prices exceeded consensus forecasts. Jobless claims were below expectations and touched the lowest level since May. Short-dated US government debt sold off, pushing the policy-sensitive two-year yield six basis points higher Thursday, largely reversing its move from the prior day.\n\nSeveral policymakers have urged a cautious approach to further rate cuts in comments this week, in light of a strong economy, lingering inflation concerns, and broad uncertainty. Their comments come at a time when the equity market is showing signs of fatigue following a post-election surge that spurred calls for a pause, with several measures highlighting "stretched" trader optimism.\n\nIn the US, the S&P 500 dropped 0.6%, while the Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.7%. Automakers like Tesla Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. slumped as Reuters reported President-elect Donald Trump plans to eliminate the \$7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases. Walt Disney Co. jumped on a profit beat.\n\nKey events this week:\n\n- China retail sales, industrial production, Friday\n\n- US retail sales, Empire manufacturing, industrial production, Friday\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\n- S&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 8:06 a.m. Tokyo time\n\n- Hang Seng futures rose 0.1%\n\n- Australia\'s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.1%\n\nCurrencies\n\n- The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.3%\n\n- The euro was unchanged at \$1.0530\n\n- The Japanese yen was little changed at 156.32 per dollar\n\n- The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2516 per dollar\n\n- The Australian dollar was little changed at \$0.6452\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\n- Bitcoin fell 1.1% to \$87,199.67\n\n- Ether fell 1.6% to \$3,069.59\n\nBonds\n\n- Australia\'s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 4.65%\n\nCommodities\n\n- West Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.1% to \$68.60 a barrel\n\n- Spot gold was little changed\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n- Elon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump\'s Government\n\n- North Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science\n\n- Oh, the Irony.
